===================

Official Youtube Plugin for XBMC (Now on GitHub)

This fork adds "Linked Resources" which extracts from the video description, links to YouTube channels, playlists, and videos.  The resources are then accessible to the user.

To access linked resources, enable the options in Settings -> Advanced -> Linked Resources.  On any video with links, a "Linked Resources" option will be available in the context menu.
